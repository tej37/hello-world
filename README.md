Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.

#git branch hello-world-images 

Now we created a new branch called "hello-world-images"
Let's confirm that we have created a new branch:
git branch
chanching from github
